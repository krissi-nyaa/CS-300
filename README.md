# Overall take-aways

1. Problems solved in projects:
	* In the course, we worked on several projects that involved designing and implementing various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hashtables, and trees. Each project
required us to approach a specific problem or task, such as sorting a list of integers, searching for an element in a sorted array, or traversing a tree structure.
	* For example, in one project, we were tasked with implementing a hash table data structure. We had to design the data structure, implement the necessary methods for inserting and retrieving
elements, and test the implementation to ensure it worked correctly.
2. Approach to problem-solving:
	* Data structures are important to understand because they provide the building blocks for creating efficient and effective algorithms. By understanding how different data structures work
and when to use them, we can write more efficient and scalable code.
	* When approaching a problem, I first identify the requirements and constraints of the problem. Then, I consider which data structure would be best suited for solving the problem based on
factors such as the size of the input, the type of operations required, and the performance requirements.
3. Roadblocks encountered and how overcome:
	* In one project, I encountered a roadblock when trying to implement a binary search algorithm. I initially struggled with understanding the logic behind the algorithm, but after breaking
it down into smaller steps and testing the implementation incrementaly, I was able to overcome the challenge.
	* Another roadblock I encountered was related to debugging an issue with the implementation of the hash-table data structure. I realized that I had made a mistake in the design, which caused the
program to crash whenver it loaded data into the table. By stepping through the code line by line and identifying the point of failure, I was able to fix the issue and get the program working correctly.
4. Expansion of approach to software design:
	* Working on these projects has expanded my approach to designing software in several ways. Firstly, I now have a better understanding of how different data structures can be used to solve
specific problems. Secondly, I have learned to consider the performance requirements and constraints of a problem when selecting a data structure. Finally, I have gained experience in
debugging and troubleshooting issues that come up (sometimes very often) during implementation.
5. Evolution of writing programs:
	* My work on these projects has evolved the way I write programs by emphasizing the way data is stored and manipulated. I also now make sure to use comments and documentation to explain
my code and make it easier for others to understand, as sometimes things get pretty complicated and backtracking is easier with good documentation :) Additionally, I try to design my code in a modular and flexible way so that it can be easily modified or extended in the future, as I did with the parser in the last project.
	* By working on these projects, I have also learned to think more critically about the design of my programs and how they can be improved over time.
